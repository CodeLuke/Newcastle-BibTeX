abstract = {Extensively class-tested, this textbook takes an innovative approach to software testing: it defines testing as the process of applying a few well-defined, general-purpose test criteria to a structure or model of the software. It incorporates the latest innovations in testing, including techniques to test modern types of software such as OO, web applications, and embedded software. The book contains numerous examples throughout. An instructor's solution manual, PowerPoint slides, sample syllabi, additional examples and updates, testing tools for students, and example software programs in Java are available on an extensive website.},

@article{Stevens1999,
abstract = {Considerations and techniques are proposed that reduce the complexity of programs by dividing them into functional modules. This can make it possible to create complex systems from simple, independent, reusable modules. Debugging and modifying programs, reconfiguring I/O devices, and managing large programming projects can all be greatly simplified. And, as the module library grows, increasingly sophisticated programs can be implemented using less and less new code.},
